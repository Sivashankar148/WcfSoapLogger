## Usage examples ##

* **Alpha:** basic web-service and client, no logging
* **Beta:** default logging (config only)
* **Gamma:** custom logging (via custom code)
* **Delta:** https + basic authentication
* **Epsilon:** code-only endpoints (no config files at all)


## How to run examples ##

1. Clone the repository or download as [zip file](https://github.com/capslocky/WcfSoapLogger/archive/master.zip).
2. Open and build solution **\src\Library** (so you will have \WcfSoapLogger\bin\Debug\WcfSoapLogger.dll)
3. Open and build solution **\src\UsageExamples\ExampleCommon** (it contains common example code as dll)
4. Open example solution and set to launch both service and client
5. Build and run solution, it will automatically open service url and logging folder


## How to setup https for example Delta ##
1. First, you need an https certificate. Let's take one generated by Fiddler when it intercepts https requests
2. Run Fiddler, enable it to see https, and open https://developer.mozilla.org/
3. Run **certmgr.msc** -> Personal -> Certificates, find __*.mozilla.org__, and export it as file with private key
4. Run **mmc** -> File -> Add Snap-in -> Certificates -> Computer account -> Local -> Personal -> Certificates, <br> and import that file
5. Set its thumbprint in **\ExampleDelta\Service\LinkSSLtoPort.bat** and run it as admin
6. Open **hosts** file in **C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc**, add line **127.0.0.1 wcf.mozilla.org**
7. Run Visual Studio as admin and open solution Delta
8. Launch both service and client, it should work
